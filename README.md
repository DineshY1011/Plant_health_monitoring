# Plant Health Monitoring System

A comprehensive IoT-based solution for monitoring and maintaining plant health using ESP32, sensors, and a Firebase-powered web dashboard.

## Project Overview
This project enables real-time monitoring and automation for plant care. It collects data from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, water level) and controls a water pump, with all data visualized on a modern web dashboard. Alerts and SMS notifications are sent for critical conditions.

## Features
- **Live Dashboard:** View soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and water tank level in real time.
- **Automatic & Manual Watering:**
  - Automatic mode: Waters plants when soil is dry.
  - Manual mode: Remotely control the water pump from the dashboard.
- **Watering History:** Track watering events and amounts.
- **Critical Alerts:**
  - Low water tank notifications.
  - SMS alerts for critical water levels.
- **Device Status:** Connection and device health monitoring.

## Hardware Requirements
- **ESP32 (with camera support, e.g., AI-Thinker module)**
- **DHT11 or DHT22 sensor** (temperature & humidity)
- **Soil moisture sensor**
- **Ultrasonic sensor** (for water tank level)
- **Relay & Water pump**
- **Jumper wires, breadboard, power supply**

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE** (with ESP32 board support)
- **Edge Impulse SDK** (for AI inferencing, optional)
- **Firebase Realtime Database**
- **Web browser** (for dashboard)

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Hardware Assembly
- Connect sensors and pump to ESP32 as per pin definitions in `Plant_health_monitoring.ino`.
- Ensure proper power supply for ESP32 and pump.

### 2. Firmware Upload
- Open `Plant_health_monitoring.ino` in Arduino IDE.
- Install required libraries:
  - `FirebaseESP32`
  - `DHT sensor library`
  - `WiFi.h`, `esp_camera.h`, etc.
- Update WiFi and Firebase credentials in the code if needed.
- Select the correct ESP32 board and port.
- Upload the code to your ESP32.

### 3. Firebase Setup
- Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Enable Realtime Database (in test mode for development).
- Copy your database URL and API key into the Arduino code.
- (Optional) Set up Firebase Hosting for the dashboard:
  - Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
  - Run `firebase login` and `firebase init hosting`
  - Deploy: `firebase deploy`

### 4. Web Dashboard
- The dashboard is in `public/index.html` and is served via Firebase Hosting.
- Access the dashboard via your Firebase Hosting URL.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage
- **Monitor:** View live sensor data and device status on the dashboard.
- **Automatic Watering:** Enable/disable via dashboard toggle.
- **Manual Watering:** Use the pump control button.
- **Alerts:** Receive notifications for low water or critical conditions.

## üì± SMS Alerts
- The ESP32 sends SMS via an external API when water level is critical. Update API credentials in the code as needed.
